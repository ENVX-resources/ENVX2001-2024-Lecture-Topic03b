### Buses
[Courtesy buses][buses] are available:

- Best option is to take the bus from **Fisher Library** to **Redfern Station**, then walk to the precinct (through the new station platform as “local traffic”).
- Alternatively, direct buses are available -- but less frequent.

### Driving
Free parking is available around Henderson Road, but it is extremely crowded. We do *not* recommend driving to the precinct.

# Why study statistics?

> Doesn't seem relevant to my degree...

## Learn, so you can...

::: {.incremental}
- Conduct effective **research**; *but if you are not a researcher*, you can still…
- Critically **evaluate** research findings; *but if you don’t plan to read scientific literature*, you can still…
- Make informed **decisions** based on evidence and know the signs when someone is trying to mislead you.

# Doing well {{< fa trophy >}}

Attend all lectures | Put in the hours | Ask questions

## {{< fa trophy >}} Attend ALL lectures 
### Attending a lecture is *not* the same as watching a recording...
- You can **ask questions** and *interact* with your peers.
- Your **lecturer** actively adjusts the pace/conten based on your *informal* feedback (e.g. confused looks, Google polls).
- If you don't *understand* something, there is a *good* chance that you can address it *before* the next lecture or lab.

## {{< fa trophy >}} Put in the hours 
- This is a **6 credit point** unit, which means that you are expected to spend **130 -- 150 hours** in total, including exam prep time (~10 h per week)!
- **Practice makes perfect**. Tutorials and Labs help you apply the concepts you learn in lectures -- complete all the exercises, and practice with the bonus questions provided.

![](images/adventuretime.gif){fig-align="center" height=350}

## {{< fa person-circle-question >}} Ask questions

- [**Ed**][edsite] is the *best* place to ask questions. We are way more responsive on **Ed** than on email.
- You *may* ask **ChatGPT** if you are stuck, or need help to understand something more general.
- We have drop-in sessions, where you can jump in and have a chat on Zoom. We will announce the schedule on **Ed**.


## Let's get started!
